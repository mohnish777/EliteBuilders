# 🔧 Login Redirect Fix

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**

**Problem:** When signing in as a host, users were redirected to the builder dashboard instead of the host dashboard.

**Root Cause:** The login page was hardcoded to redirect to `/builder/dashboard` for all users.

**Solution:** Updated login to check user's role from the database and redirect accordingly.

## 🔄 **What Changed**

### **File Modified:** `src/pages/Login.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
await signIn(email, password)
navigate('/builder/dashboard')  // ❌ Always builder dashboard
```

**After:**
```typescript
await signIn(email, password)

// Get user profile to check role
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (user) {
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('role')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single()
  
  // Redirect based on role
  if (profile?.role === 'host') {
    navigate('/host/dashboard')  // ✅ Host dashboard
  } else {
    navigate('/builder/dashboard')  // ✅ Builder dashboard
  }
}
```

## ✅ **How It Works Now**

### **Login Flow:**
```
1. User enters email/password
   ↓
2. Sign in with Supabase
   ↓
3. Fetch user profile from database
   ↓
4. Check role field
   ↓
5. Redirect based on role:
   - role = 'host' → /host/dashboard
   - role = 'builder' → /builder/dashboard
```

## 🧪 **Test It**

### **Test as Host:**
```bash
# 1. Go to login page
http://localhost:3000/login

# 2. Sign in with host credentials
# (or sign up as host first)

# 3. Should redirect to:
http://localhost:3000/host/dashboard ✅

# 4. You'll see:
# - "Host Dashboard 🎯"
# - Stats (challenges, submissions, participants)
# - "Create Challenge" button
# - Your challenges list
```

### **Test as Builder:**
```bash
# 1. Go to login page
http://localhost:3000/login

# 2. Sign in with builder credentials
# (or sign up as builder first)

# 3. Should redirect to:
http://localhost:3000/builder/dashboard ✅

# 4. You'll see:
# - "Welcome back, Builder! 🚀"
# - Stats (submissions, rank, points)
# - Available challenges
```

## 📋 **Other Pages (Already Correct)**

### **Signup Page** ✅
Already redirects based on selected role:
```typescript
navigate(userType === 'builder' ? '/builder/dashboard' : '/host/dashboard')
```

### **GitHub OAuth** ✅
Defaults to builder dashboard (GitHub users are developers):
```typescript
navigate('/builder/dashboard')
```
