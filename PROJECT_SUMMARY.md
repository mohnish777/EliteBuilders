   - Edge functions for LLM scoring
   - Email templates for notifications

3. **Keep It Simple**
   - MVP first, polish later
   - Use existing UI components
   - Don't over-engineer
   - Ship fast, iterate faster

4. **Test Early**
   - Create test data in Supabase
   - Test both user types (builder/host)
   - Mobile testing from day 1
   - Get feedback from real users

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Node Version**: You're on v14.15.5, some packages want v16+
   - Everything works but you'll see warnings
   - Consider upgrading: `nvm install 18 && nvm use 18`

2. **Environment Variables**: Must restart dev server after changing `.env`

3. **Supabase Setup**: Required before app will work
   - Follow SETUP.md carefully
   - Test auth in Supabase dashboard first
