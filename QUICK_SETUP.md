├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         🏆                          │
│  No challenges created yet          │
│                                     │
│  [+ Create Your First Challenge]    │

## 🎯 **Alternative: Insert Challenges Manually via SQL**

If the button doesn't work, go to Supabase and run this SQL:

### **Step 1: Get your Host ID**

```sql
-- Run this first to get your host user ID
SELECT id, email, role, company_name 
FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'host' 
LIMIT 1;
```

Copy the `id` value (it looks like: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`)

### **Step 2: Insert Challenges**

Replace `YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE` with the ID you copied, then run:

```sql
-- Challenge 1
INSERT INTO challenges (title, description, duration_hours, host_id, status) VALUES (
  'Build a Real-Time Chat App with AI',
  'Create a real-time chat application with AI-powered features like message suggestions and smart replies. Must include user authentication, presence indicators, and message history.',
  168,
  'YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE',
  'active'
);

-- Challenge 2
INSERT INTO challenges (title, description, duration_hours, host_id, status) VALUES (
  'AI-Powered Code Review Assistant',
  'Build a tool that uses AI to review code and provide actionable feedback on bugs, security issues, and best practices. Support for JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript required.',
  336,
  'YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE',
  'active'
);

-- Challenge 3
INSERT INTO challenges (title, description, duration_hours, host_id, status) VALUES (
  'AI Meme Generator - Weekend Sprint',
  'Create an AI-powered meme generator that creates funny, relevant memes based on trending topics or user input. Quick weekend project!',
  48,
  'YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE',
  'active'
);

-- Challenge 4
INSERT INTO challenges (title, description, duration_hours, host_id, status) VALUES (
  'AI Task Manager with Smart Scheduling',
  'Build a task management app that uses AI to optimize your schedule and prioritize tasks intelligently. Include calendar integration and progress tracking.',
  240,
  'YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE',
  'active'
);

-- Challenge 5
INSERT INTO challenges (title, description, duration_hours, host_id, status) VALUES (
  'Interactive Data Dashboard Builder',
  'Create a no-code dashboard builder that allows users to visualize data from multiple sources with drag-and-drop simplicity.',
  168,
  'YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE',
  'active'
);

-- Challenge 6
INSERT INTO challenges (title, description, duration_hours, host_id, status) VALUES (
  'AI Recipe Generator - 24 Hour Sprint',
  'Build an AI app that generates creative recipes based on ingredients you have at home. Ultra-quick 24-hour challenge!',
  24,
  'YOUR_HOST_ID_HERE',
  'active'
);
```

## 🔍 **Verify Challenges Exist**

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT id, title, duration_hours, status, created_at 
FROM challenges 
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**You should see 6 rows!**
